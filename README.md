# matplotlib_challenge

Please find attached 'matplotlib_challenge.ipynb' as well as other assignment files.

Within 'matplotlib_challenge.ipynb' you will find my code for the assignment, all required data frames, charts & a brief analysis at the end.

Please note:
To my understanding, there was no grading criteria for the analysis, so I hope what I have presented suffices.
The data charts may not look exactly the same as what was provided to me as a guide. The data is either in a different colour/format, or presented in a different order. Nonetheless, the data is still the same.

I would also like to mention I had used a different mouse for the line chart, however it was still a mouse treated by the capomulin drug regimen.
To my understanding, it is acceptable to use any mouse tested by capomulin.

I understand these may be obvious statements, this is just something I would like to clarify.

Happy reading!
